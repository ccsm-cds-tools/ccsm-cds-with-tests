    text: 'If a high-grade cytologic abnormality (HSIL, ASC-H) without histologic HSIL persists for 2 years, a diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended (unless the patient is pregnant). A diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended in patients when the squamocolumnar junction or the upper limit of all lesions are not fully visualized.'
