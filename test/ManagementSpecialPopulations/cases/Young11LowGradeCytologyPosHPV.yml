    action: 'Cytology'
    text: 'Repeat cytology alone at one and two years is recommended after an initial low-grade cytology screening result of LSIL, ASC-US HPV-positive, or ASC-US result without HPV testing (BII). Clinicians should switch to using risk estimates when patients reach the age of 25 years.'
