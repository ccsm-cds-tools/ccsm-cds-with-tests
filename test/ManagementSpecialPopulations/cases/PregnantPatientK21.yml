    action: 'PregnantPatientK2'
    text: 'Surveillance colposcopy and testing (with diagnostic cytology or HPV depending on age) is preferred every 12 to 24 weeks but deferring colposcopy to the postpartum period is acceptable (BII). In postpartum period, colposcopy is recommended no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery (BII). In patients diagnosed with histologic HSIL (CIN2 or CIN3) during pregnancy, if a lesion is detected at postpartum colposcopy, an excisional treatment procedure or full diagnostic evaluation (cervical cytology, HPV, and biopsy) is acceptable (BII). In the absence of a lesion on colposcopy, a full diagnostic evaluation is recommended/ expedited treatment is not recommended (BII). For patients with a diagnosis of histologic HSIL (CIN 2) whose concerns about the effects of treatment on a future pregnancy outweigh their concerns about cancer, either observation or treatment is acceptable provided the squamocolumnar junction is visible and CIN 2+ or ungraded CIN is not identified on endocervical sampling (CII). If the histologic HSIL cannot be specified as CIN 2, treatment is preferred, but observation is acceptable if there are concerns related to future pregnancies (CIII). For patients 25 years or older, observation includes colposcopy and HPV-based testing with cotest or primary hrHPV testing at 6-month intervals for up to 2 years.'
