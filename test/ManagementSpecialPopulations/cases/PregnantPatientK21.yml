    - 'Surveillance colposcopy and testing (with cytology or HPV testing or co-testing depending on age) is preferred every 12 to 24 weeks but deferring colposcopy to the postpartum period is acceptable.'
    - 'Repeat biopsy is recommended if invasion is suspected or the appearance of the lesion worsens.'
    - 'Treatment of histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3) during pregnancy is not recommended.'
