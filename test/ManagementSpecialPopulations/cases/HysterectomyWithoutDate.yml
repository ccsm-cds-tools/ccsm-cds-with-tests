  Recommendation: 
    short: 'Surveillance'
    date: '2021-06-02'
    group: 'Hysterectomy (K.4)'
    details:
    - 'This patient has documentation of a hysterectomy. If hysterectomy was performed for treatment of histologic HSIL, CIN 2, CIN 3 or AIS, patients should have 3 consecutive annual primary HPV tests or cotests before entering long term surveillance. Long term surveillance involves primary HPV testing or cotesting at 3-year intervals for 25 years.'
    - 'Screening is generally not recommended after hysterectomy if no previous diagnosis of CIN2 or greater in the preceding 25 years and the cervix was removed at the time of hysterectomy.'
    - 'Cancer screening is not recommended for patients who have undergone hysterectomy but have no previous diagnosis of histologic HSIL, CIN 2, CIN 3 or AIS, or completed the 25 year long term surveillance.'
