  Recommendation: 
    short: 'See Details'
    date: '2024-05-01'
    group: 'Hysterectomy (K.4)'
    details:
    - 'This patient has documentation of a hysterectomy. If hysterectomy was performed for treatment of histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3), patients should have 3 consecutive annual HPV-based tests before entering long term surveillance. Long term surveillance involves HPV based testing at 3-year intervals for 25 years.'
    - 'Screening is generally not recommended after hysterectomy if no previous diagnosis of CIN2 or greater in the preceding 25 years and the cervix was removed at the time of hysterectomy.'
    - 'Cancer screening is not recommended for patients who have undergone hysterectomy but have no previous diagnosis of histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3), or completed the 25 year long term surveillance.'
