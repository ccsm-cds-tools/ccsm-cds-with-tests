  RecommendationText:
  - 'A diagnostic pelvic exam is recommended for patients with abnormal uterine bleeding. If a cervical lesion is seen a cytology, co-testing and/or cervical biopsy should be considered. If there is concern for endometrial cancer or other endometrial pathology, and endometrial biopsy should be considered.'
