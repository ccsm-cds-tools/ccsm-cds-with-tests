  RecommendationText: 'Per the ASCCP Clinical Practice Statement titled "Evaluation of the Cervix in Patients with Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding" a diagnostic exam is indicated. Cervical cancer is unlikely in women with negative cervical cytology in the past year, therefore pap testing may be deferred unless the exam is highly suspicious for cervical cancer.'
