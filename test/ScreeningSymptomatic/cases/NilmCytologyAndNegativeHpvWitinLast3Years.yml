  Recommendation: 'Per the ASCCP Clinical Practice Statement titled "Evaluation of the Cervix in Patients with Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding" a diagnostic exam is indicated. Cervical cancer is unlikely in women with negative cervical cytology/HPV cotesting in the past 3 years, therefore pap testing may be deferred unless the exam is highly suspicious for cervical cancer.'
