  RecommendationText:
  - 'A diagnostic pelvic exam is recommended for patients with abnormal uterine bleeding.'
  - 'Cervical cancer is unlikely in women with negative cervical cytology/HPV cotesting in the past 3 years, therefore Pap testing may be deferred unless the exam is highly suspicious for cervical cancer.'
