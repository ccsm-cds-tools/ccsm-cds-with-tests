  Recommendation:
    short: 'Colposcopy'
    date: '2021-06-02'
    group: 'Surveillance (Table 2)'
    details:
    - 'For patients 25 years or older, when patients have an estimated immediate risk of diagnosis of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or greater based on history and current results, referral to colposcopy is recommended (AII). Endocervical curettage, endometrial biopsy, and treatment without biopsy are unacceptable during pregnancy (EIII). A diagnostic excisional procedure or repeat biopsy is recommended only if cancer is suspected based on cytology, colposcopy, or histology (BII).'
