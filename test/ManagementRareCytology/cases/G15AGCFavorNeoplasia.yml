    details:
    - "For patients with atypical glandular or endocervical cells 'favor neoplasia' or endocervical AIS cytology, if invasive disease is not identified during initial colposcopic workup, a diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended. The diagnostic excisional procedure used in this setting should provide an intact specimen with interpretable margins (BII). Endocervical sampling above the excisional bed is preferred (BII)."
