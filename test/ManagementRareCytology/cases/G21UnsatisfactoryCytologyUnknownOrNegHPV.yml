    text: 'For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) in 2 to 4 months is recommended (BIII). Triage using HPV testing is not recommended (DIII). Before repeat cytology, treatment to resolve atrophy or obscuring inflammation when a specific infection is present is acceptable (CIII).'
