  RecommendationText:
  - "For immunosuppressed individuals age 21 to 29, cervical cytology screening is recommended at the time of initial diagnosis, and should occur annually for 3 consecutive normal tests."
  - "If the results of 3 consecutive cytology tests are normal, follow-up cytology screening should occur every 3 years until the age of 30 (given normal results)."
  - "After 30, continue screening with cytology alone or cotesting every 3 years and continue throughout the patient's lifetime."
