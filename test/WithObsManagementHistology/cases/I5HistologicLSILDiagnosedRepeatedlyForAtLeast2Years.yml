    short: 'Surveillance'
    date: '2021-06-02'
    group: 'Managing Histology (I.5)'
    details: 
      - 'Histologic LSIL (CIN1) is not considered a cancer precursor, so observation is preferred. Treatment is acceptable if strongly preferred by the patient.'
      - 'If treatment is selected and the entire squamocolumnar junction and all lesions were fully visualized during colposcopic examination, either excision or ablation treatments are acceptable.'
