    short: 'Surveillance or Treatment'
    date: '2021-06-02'
    group: 'Managing Histology (I.2)'
    details: 
      - "Treatment of CIN2 is recommended unless the patient's concerns about the effect of treatment on future pregnancy outweigh concerns about cancer."
      - 'Excisional treatment is preferred, and treatment with ablation is acceptable.'
      - 'Observation is unacceptable when the squamocolumnar junction or the upper limit of the lesion is not fully visualized or when the results of an endocervical sampling, if performed, is CIN 2+ or ungraded.'
      - 'Observation includes colposcopy and HPV-based testing with cotest or primary hrHPV testing at 6-month intervals for up to 2 years.'
