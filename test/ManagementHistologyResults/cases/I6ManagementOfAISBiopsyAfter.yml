  Recommendation:
    short: 'See Details'
    date: '2021-06-02'
    group: 'Managing Histology (I.6)'
    details:
      - 'A diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended for all patients with a diagnosis of AIS on cervical biopsy to rule out invasive adenocarcinoma.'
      - 'If negative margins on the excisional specimen, a hysterectomy is preferred although fertility-sparing management for appropriately selected patients is acceptable.'
      - 'For patients who undergo fertility-sparing management, surveillance with cotesting and endocervical sampling is recommended every 6 months for at least 3 years, then annually for at least 2 years, or until hysterectomy is performed.'
      - 'If an abnormal result is returned during surveillance, manage using the 2019 ASCCP guidelines.'
