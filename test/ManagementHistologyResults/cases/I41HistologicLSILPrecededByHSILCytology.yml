    details: 
      - 'Immediate diagnostic excisional procedure (unless the patient is pregnant), or observation with primary HPV testing or cotesting and colposcopy at 1 year are acceptable.'
      - 'Observation is only acceptable when the initial colposcopic examination fully visualized the squamocolumnar junction and the upper limit of any lesion, and that the endocervical sampling, if collected, was less than CIN 2.'
