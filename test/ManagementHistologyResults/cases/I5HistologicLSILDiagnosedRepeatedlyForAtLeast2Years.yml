    action: 'ManagementHistologyI5'
    text: 'For patients 25 years or older with histologic LSIL (CIN 1) who is diagnosed at consecutive visits for at least 2 years, observation is preferred (BII) but treatment is acceptable (CIII). If treatment is selected and the entire squamocolumnar junction and all lesions were fully visualized during colposcopic examination, either excision or ablation treatments are acceptable (CII).'
