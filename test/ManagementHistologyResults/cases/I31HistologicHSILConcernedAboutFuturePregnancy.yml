    details: 
      - 'For patients with a diagnosis of histologic HSIL (CIN 2) whose concerns about the effects of treatment on a future pregnancy outweigh their concerns about cancer, either observation or treatment is acceptable provided the squamocolumnar junction is visible and CIN 2+ or ungraded CIN is not identified on endocervical sampling (CII). For patients 25 years or older, observation includes colposcopy and HPV-based testing with cotest or primary hrHPV testing at 6-month intervals for up to 2 years.'
