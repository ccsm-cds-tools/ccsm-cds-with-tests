    action: 'ManagementHistologyI2'
    text: 'Treatment is recommended, and observation is unacceptable (AII). When treatment of histologic HSIL is planned, excisional treatment is preferred, and treatment with ablation is acceptable (BI). Outside of the setting of a clinical research trial, nonsurgical therapies, including topical agents, therapeutic vaccines, and other biologics, are unacceptable for the treatment of histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3) (DIII). Hysterectomy is unacceptable as primary therapy solely for the treatment of histologic HSIL (CIN 2, CIN 3, or unqualified) (EII). When considering ablative therapy, in particular cryotherapy, ablation is unacceptable in the following circumstances as defined by the WHO: (a) the lesion extends into the canal and (b) when the lesion covers more than 75% of the surface area of the ectocervix or extends beyond the cryotip being used. Additional situations for which cryotherapy is not recommended include the following: (a) the squamocolumnar junction or the upper limit of any lesion is not fully visualized; (b) endocervical canal sample is diagnosed as CIN 2+ or CIN that cannot be graded; (c) after previous treatment for CIN 2+; (d) in the setting of inadequate biopsies of the cervix to confirm histologic diagnosis; and (e) if cancer is suspected (EIII).'
