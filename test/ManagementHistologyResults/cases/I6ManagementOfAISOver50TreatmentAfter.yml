    date: '2021-06-02'
    group: 'Managing Histology (I.6)'
    details:
      - 'If negative margins on the diagnostic excisional specimen, a hysterectomy is preferred.'
      - 'For patients with positive margins on the excisional specimen, re-excision to achieve negative margins is preferred, even if hysterectomy is planned.'
      - 'For patients with AIS and persistent positive margins for whom additional excisional procedures are not feasible, either a simple or modified radical hysterectomy is acceptable.'
