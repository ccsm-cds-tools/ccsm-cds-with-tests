    action: 'ManagementHistologyI6'
    text: "A diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended for all patients with a diagnosis of AIS on cervical biopsy to rule out invasive adenocarcinoma, even when definitive hysterectomy is planned. Excisional procedures should optimally remove an intact specimen to facilitate accurate interpretation of margin status. Although there is no preference for cold knife conization versus LEEP, intentional disruption of the specimen by performance of a LEEP followed by a 'top hat' endocervical excision to achieve the desired specimen length is unacceptable. An excisional specimen length of at least 10 mm is preferred, and this can be increased to 18 to 20 mm for patients who are not concerned about the effect of treatment on future pregnancy. These dimensions are preferred regardless of whether hysterectomy is planned. After the initial diagnostic procedure, hysterectomy is the preferred management for all patients who have a histologic diagnosis of AIS, although fertility-sparing management for appropriately selected patients is acceptable. For patients with confirmed AIS with negative margins on the excisional specimen, simple hysterectomy is preferred. For patients with confirmed AIS with positive margins on the excisional specimen, re-excision to achieve negative margins is preferred, even if hysterectomy is planned. For patients with AIS and persistent positive margins for whom additional excisional procedures are not feasible, either a simple or modified radical hysterectomy is acceptable. After hysterectomy, surveillance per the ASCCP surveillance guidelines for treated CIN 2+ is recommended (Section J.3).\n\nFor patients of reproductive age who desire future pregnancy, fertility-sparing management with an excisional procedure is acceptable provided that negative margins have been achieved on the excisional specimen, and the patient is willing and able to adhere to surveillance recommendations. If negative margins cannot be achieved after maximal excisional attempts, fertility-sparing management is not recommended. For patients who undergo fertility-sparing management, surveillance with cotesting and endocervical sampling is recommended every 6 months for at least 3 years, then annually for at least 2 years, or until hysterectomy is performed. For patients who have consistently negative cotesting and endocervical sampling results for 5 years, extending the surveillance interval to every 3 years starting in the sixth year of surveillance is acceptable. Small retrospective studies have shown HPV test results to be the best predictor for recurrent disease. Therefore, for patients who have consistently negative cotesting and endocervical sampling results, continued surveillance is acceptable after completion of childbearing. For patients who have had positive HPV test results or abnormal cytology/histologic results during surveillance, hysterectomy at the completion of childbearing is preferred (see Figure 11)."
