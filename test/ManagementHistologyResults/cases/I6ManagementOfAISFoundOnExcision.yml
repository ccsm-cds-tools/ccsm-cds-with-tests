  Recommendation:
    short: 'Hysterectomy'
    date: '2021-06-02'
    group: 'Managing Histology (I.6)'
    details:
      - 'If negative margins on the diagnostic excisional specimen, a hysterectomy is preferred although fertility-sparing management for appropriately selected patients is acceptable.'
      - 'For patients with positive margins on the excisional specimen, re-excision to achieve negative margins is preferred, even if hysterectomy is planned.'
      - 'For patients who undergo fertility-sparing management, surveillance with cotesting and endocervical sampling is recommended every 6 months for at least 3 years, then annually for at least 2 years, or until hysterectomy is performed.'
      - 'If cotesting and endocervical sampling consistently negative in first 5 years, extending surveillance interval to every 3 years is acceptable.'
      - 'If an abnormal result is returned during surveillance, manage using the 2019 ASCCP guidelines.'
