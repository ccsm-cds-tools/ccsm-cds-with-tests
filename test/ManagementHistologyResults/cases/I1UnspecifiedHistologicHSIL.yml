    group: 'Managing Histology (I.1)'
    details: 
      - 'Treatment is preferred if histologic HSIL cannot be specified (e.g., reported as histologic HSIL or histologic HSIL [CIN 2,3]) (CIII), but observation is acceptable if there are concerns related to future pregnancies (CIII). For patients 25 years or older, observation includes colposcopy and HPV-based testing with cotest or primary hrHPV testing at 6-month intervals for up to 2 years.'
