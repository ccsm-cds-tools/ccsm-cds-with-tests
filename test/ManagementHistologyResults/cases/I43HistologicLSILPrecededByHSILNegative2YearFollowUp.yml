    date: '2021-06-02'
    group: 'Managing Histology (I.4.3.2)'
    details: 
      - 'Retest with HPV-based testing (i.e., cotesting or primary hrHPV testing) every 3 years after surveillance tests are negative during the 2-year observation period following histologic LSIL (CIN1) or less preceded by ASC-H or HSIL cytology. Proceed with long-term surveillance (i.e., HPV-based testing every 3 years for at least 25 years, even if this is beyond the age of 65 years (BII).'
