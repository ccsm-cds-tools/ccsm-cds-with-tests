  Recommendation:
    short: 'Colposcopy'
    date: '2021-06-02'
    group: '2023 JLGTD Addendum to the 2019 ASCCP Guidelines'
    details:
    - 'Colposcopy is recommended.'
    - 'If the previous cytology result was not high grade, and the patient undergoes repeat testing with HPV testing or cotesting instead of colposcopy: colposcopy is recommended if the result on repeat testing indicates a second consecutive HPV-positive result and/or persistent cytologic abnormality (ASC-US or a more severe cytologic interpretation); repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year is acceptable if the result on repeat testing is HPV negative or cotest negative.'
