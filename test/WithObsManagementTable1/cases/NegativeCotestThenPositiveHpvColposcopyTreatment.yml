  Recommendation:
    short: 'Colposcopy or Treatment'
    date: '2021-06-02'
    group: 'General Screening (Table 1)'
    details:
    - 'For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with an estimated immediate risk of CIN 3+ 25% or greater and less than 60% based on history and current results, treatment using an excisional procedure without previous biopsy confirmation or histologic evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy are both acceptable (AII).'
    - 'Endocervical curettage, endometrial biopsy, and treatment without biopsy are unacceptable during pregnancy (EIII). A diagnostic excisional procedure or repeat biopsy is recommended only if cancer is suspected based on cytology, colposcopy, or histology (BII). For patients with a diagnosis of histologic HSIL (CIN 2) whose concerns about the effects of treatment on a future pregnancy outweigh their concerns about cancer, either observation or treatment is acceptable provided the squamocolumnar junction is visible and CIN 2+ or ungraded CIN is not identified on endocervical sampling (CII). If the histologic HSIL cannot be specified as CIN 2, treatment is preferred, but observation is acceptable if there are concerns related to future pregnancies (CIII). For patients 25 years or older, observation includes colposcopy and HPV-based testing with cotest or primary hrHPV testing at 6-month intervals for up to 2 years.'
