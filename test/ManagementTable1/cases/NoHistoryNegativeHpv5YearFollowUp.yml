  Recommendation:
    short: 'Surveillance'
    date: '2026-05-01'
    group: 'General Screening (Table 1)'
    details:
    - 'When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of less than 0.15% based on past history and current test results, return to routine screening at 5-year intervals using HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).'
    - 'After abnormal cervical cancer screening test results for patients 25 years or older, colposcopic biopsy results, or treatment of histologic HSIL, surveillance with either HPV testing alone or cotesting is preferred (AI). Surveillance with cervical cytology alone is acceptable only if testing with HPV or cotesting is not feasible (CIII). Cytology is recommended at 6-month intervals when 1-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting, and annually when 3-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting (AII).'
