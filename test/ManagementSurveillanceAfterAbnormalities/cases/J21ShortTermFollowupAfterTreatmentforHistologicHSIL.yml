    action: 'ManagementSurveillanceJ2'
    text: 'After treatment, hrHPV-based testing is preferred at 6 months regardless of the margin status of the excisional specimen (BII). hrHPV-based testing includes cotesting and primary hrHPV testing. Follow-up at 6 months with colposcopy and ECC is acceptable (BIII). When margins are positive for CIN 2+ or ECC performed at the time of the excisional procedure shows CIN 2+ in patients 25 years or older who are not concerned about the potential effect of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes, repeat excision or observation is acceptable. For observation, HPV-based testing in 6 months is preferred; it is also acceptable to perform a colposcopy and ECC at 6 months.'
