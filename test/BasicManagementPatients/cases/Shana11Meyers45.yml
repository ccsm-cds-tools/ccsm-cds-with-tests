    details:
    - "Histologic LSIL (CIN1) is not considered a cancer precursor, so observation is preferred. Treatment is acceptable if strongly preferred by the patient."
    - "If treatment is selected and the entire squamocolumnar junction and all lesions were fully visualized during colposcopic examination, either excision or ablation treatments are acceptable."
