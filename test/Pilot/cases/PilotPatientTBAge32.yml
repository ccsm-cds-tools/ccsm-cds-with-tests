    details:
    - "Treatment of CIN2 is recommended unless the patient's concerns about the effect of treatment on future pregnancy outweigh concerns about cancer."
    - "Excisional treatment is preferred, and treatment with ablation is acceptable."
    - "Observation is unacceptable when the squamocolumnar junction or the upper limit of the lesion is not fully visualized or when the results of an endocervical sampling, if performed, is CIN 2+ or ungraded."
    - "Observation includes colposcopy and primary hrHPV testing or cotesting at 6-month intervals for up to 2 years."
