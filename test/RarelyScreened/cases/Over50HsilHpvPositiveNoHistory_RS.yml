    details:
    - 'Treatment using an excisional procedure without previous biopsy confirmation is preferred, but colposcopy with biopsy is acceptable.'
    - 'For patients who have not been screened within the past 5 years or more, risks are higher and treatment is preferred to colposcopy to minimize loss to follow-up.'
