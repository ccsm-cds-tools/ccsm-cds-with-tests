  Recommendation:
    short: 'Colposcopy or Treatment'
    date: '2021-06-02'
    group: 'General Screening (Table 1)'
    details:
    - 'Treatment using an excisional procedure without previous biopsy confirmation is preferred, but colposcopy with biopsy is acceptable.'
    - 'For patients who have not been screened within the past 5 years or more, risks are higher and treatment is preferred to colposcopy to minimize loss to follow-up.'
    - 'If the patient is currently pregnant, endocervical curettage, endometrial biopsy, and treatment without biopsy are unacceptable.'
