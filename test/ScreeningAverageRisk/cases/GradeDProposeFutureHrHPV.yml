  RecommendationText: 'hrHPV is next due on 2025-05-01. Note: hrHPV seems to either 1) be the preferred screening approach, or 2) is most evident in the patient record. Per USPSTF guidelines, screening can be performed by using: 1) cervical cytology testing alone, 2) hrHPV testing alone, or 3) cotesting with cervical cytology testing and hrHPV testing.'
