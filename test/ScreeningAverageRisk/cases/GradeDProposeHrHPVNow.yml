  RecommendationText: 'Per USPSTF guidelines, this patient is due for cervical cancer screening because they have not been adequately screened in the past. Adequate testing is defined as having: 1) three consecutive negative cytology results within 10 years prior to screening, 2) two consecutive negative hrHPV results within 10 years prior to the end of screening, with the most recent test occurring within 5 years or 3) two consecutive negative cotesting results within 10 years prior to the end of screening, with the most recent test occurring within 5 years. It appears that this patient is on a screening regimen that includes hrHPV. To meet "adequate testing criteria", hrHPV is recommended.'
