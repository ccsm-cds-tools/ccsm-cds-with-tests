  RecommendationText: 'Cotesting with hrHPV and Cervical Cytology is next due on 2025-05-01. Note: Cotesting with hrHPV and Cervical Cytology seems to either 1) be the preferred screening approach, or 2) is most evident in the patient record. Per USPSTF guidelines, screening can be performed by using: 1) cervical cytology testing alone, 2) hrHPV testing alone, or 3) cotesting with cervical cytology testing and hrHPV testing.'
